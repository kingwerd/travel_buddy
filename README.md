# Travel Buddy
Trip planning application built with the Django framework. It requires users to register and login before they are able to perform any actions. Once logged in and registered the user is able to see trips that are planned by other user and join them. Once a user has joined a trip the trip is placed in a table showing what trips the currently signed in user is attending. Users can also create their own trips, but must have valid dates for the trip or it will return a validation error to the user.

The application was deployed using an AWS EC2 instance. To view the site navigate to <http://3.95.134.108/>!
